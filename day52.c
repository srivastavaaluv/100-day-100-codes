/* Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
Input 1:
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output 1:
2
Explanation 1:
Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, whose index is 2.
Input 2:
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output 2:
-1
Explanation 2:
No element greater than 20 is found. So output is -1.
Input 3:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output 3:
0
Explanation 3:
Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, whose indices are 0 and 1. The index of the first occurrence is 0.
Input 4:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 2
Output 4:
2
Explanation 4:
If x is directly present, return the index of its first occurrence.*/
